## Design Plan
- The major focus of the first phase of this project was the design layout utilizing Bootstrap. This proved to be incredibly fast and convenient. Although I can certainly appreciate the ease, I find the limitations not worthwhile. See challenges below for more detail.

## Challenges Encountered and Knowledge Gained
* I created the first phase of the site several months before returning to it. In the time I was away from the project, a new version of Bootstrap was released. Updating to it was a learning experience in itself. Albeit not difficult, it required a complete replacement of all components.
